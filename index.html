          As a graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Technology,
		  I am driven by a passion for leveraging computer science to address real-world 
		  challenges. My academic journey has cultivated a deep interest in Java/Python/C/C++ programming, 
		  Artificial Intelligence, and software engineering. I am eager to delve deeper into these areas, 
		  particularly focusing on how advanced technologies can be harnessed to innovate and solve complex problems.<br><br>

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of pursuing a master's degree in China, 
where I aim to further specialize in cutting-edge technology and research. This 
opportunity will enable me to engage with diverse international perspectives, 
collaborate with esteemed professors, and contribute to significant 
advancements in the field. My goal is to immerse myself in a rigorous 
academic environment that fosters innovation and research excellence, 
ultimately enhancing my ability to make meaningful contributions to the 
global tech community.

            <h3>The Research on Image Denoising Methods Based on The Deep Learning Theory (Thesis)</h3>
            During my bachelor degree I worked on image denoising based 
			on deep learning research project. This research 
			project has enriched my understanding of deep 
			learning, image processing, and evaluation metrics. 
			By comparing the Autoencoder and GAN methods, 
			I gained insights into their strengths and weaknesses 
			in the context of image denoising. This experience 
			has not only expanded my technical skills but also 
			deepened my appreciation for the complex world of 
			deep-learning research.

            <h3>Clinic Management Project (Team-Based)</h3>
            During my bachelor degree I also worked on the development 
			of a clinic management web-based application project. 
			As the team leader, I played a central role in guiding 
			our team toward success. Leading the Clinic Management System 
			project was a rewarding experience that reinforced the 
			importance of effective leadership, teamwork, and technical 
			expertise. Our team's collective efforts resulted in the 
			successful delivery of a valuable solution for clinic management. 
			This experience has deepened my understanding of project management, 
			technical leadership, and software engineering, and I look 
			forward to applying these skills in future projects and leadership roles.
